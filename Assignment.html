			<h1>Affable Dogs</h1>
			<h2>Chocolate Labs</h2>
			<blockquote cite="https://www.rover.com/blog/breed-article-labrador-retriever">[T]he Labrador retriever is one of the most popular dogs in the United States (and in much of the world). ... The Labrador retriever was bred to be friendly, both toward humans and other dogs. To complement that gentle nature, their working history gives them a high-energy, fearless, enthusiastic personality. Labs are curious and intelligent, which means they do well as service dogs, but this can mean that your single-minded lab is more likely to escape or suddenly disappear, most likely having followed something interesting (squirrel?). This is why many owners of Labrador retriever dogs choose to microchip their pets. <a href="https://www.rover.com/blog/breed-article-labrador-retriever" target="_blank">Source</a></blockquote>

		<h3>Family Dogs</h3>
		<p><a href="Dog.html">Bernese Mountain Dogs</a> are both affable and devoted to "their" children.
		<blockquote cite="https://www.rover.com/blog/5-facts-bernese-mountain-dog-lovers-know-heart">There’s something quintessentially dog about the Bernese Mountain Dog. They’re substantial creatures, weighing 70 to 110 pounds; they’re tough and sturdy but covered in gorgeous, soft fur; and their colors and markings give them an almost Platonic dog appearance. They’re an ideal combination of robust and cuddly. ... If you absolutely need a dog to babysit your small child, the Bernese Mountain Dog should be top your choice. (This would not be the most irresponsible idea you’ve had, but also: don’t allow dogs to babysit your children.) Despite their large size and tough build, the Bernese Mountain Dog is extremely friendly, gentle, and loving. <a href="https://www.rover.com/blog/5-facts-bernese-mountain-dog-lovers-know-heart" target="_blank">Source</a></blockquote>
